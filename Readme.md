#About

This is LearnAR, coded with SwiftUI designed to work for Swift Playground, run with MacOS 13.2 or with iPhone (Well I don't have iPad')

###What is LearnAR?
LearnAR is a simple app for college student (like me) for reviewing the subject for upcoming test. Where the user can learn all the topics they learnt in the class, and the teacher can give quiz for the student and do it right on the app. The user also can select different types of topics that has been set by the teacher.

###What's the AR?
This is a *upcoming* feature that utilize ARKit for student to use in class, to view current topic illustration.
